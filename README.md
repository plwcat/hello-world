# hello-world
Welcome to my very snazzy GitHub page! 

Very inspired by the Women in Computing Conference this weekend. Hello new PC - or should I say "device" as Microsoft does? 

Took C++ years ago and dropped Java. The teacher really needed his java... He arrived late to the first class with coffee dumped all down his shirt, and told us proudly that this class had one of the highest drop rates of all, and many of us wouldn't even make it the first few weeks. Way to encourage!

Looking forward to more hands-on learning and getting involved in Girl Develop It Rochester. Cheers to you whoever you are, and to wherever and whoever I will be on 4/22/2018 in another year!
